# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview
In this analysis we want to take the data we currently have and show a multiple line chart  for total fares by city type over a period of time. We did this by putting together the data frames we currently have into a clean merged summary to get us to our eventual line chart.
# Results
As seen in the image below. The total rides the more densely populated city types produce the most amount of rides. This trend can also see this in the total drivers but at ratio. For example Urban city types have about 148% more drivers than rides while Rural areas have 63% drivers of the total amount of rides. Urban areas account for over 60% of the Total fares for Pyber. When it comes to the averages for a ride or a drive, the average fair has a lower fare with the higher amount of total rides and drivers respectively.

# Summary
- Looking at the lack of drivers within Rural areas. Doing a new promotion for new drivers to increase the supply of drivers to reduce the the average rate to increase the demand of people wanting to take rides in Rural areas
- Urban areas seem to have too many drivers , more drivers than rides. In the same note since we have these drivers in Urban areas you could try promoting or incentivizing drivers to drive in specific areas that lack drivers
- Looking at the lack of drivers within Suburban areas. Doing a new promotion for new drivers to increase the supply of drivers to reduce the the average rate to increase the demand of people wanting to take rides in Suburban areas
